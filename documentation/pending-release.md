# Pending production release

Everything below is on **dev.ultralove.ca** and waits for the client's approval, then ships to
production as one release. Code goes through `deploy/deploy.sh` (see the `ultralove-deploy` skill);
the database / plugin steps are **not code** and have to be repeated on the production server by hand,
in the order listed.

## Code

Nothing pending: production runs `main` (`86a1b18`, deployed 2026-09-30).

## Production steps after the code deploy

None pending.

## Already on production (not part of a release)

Release of 2026-09-29 / 2026-09-30 (code: product cards and carousels, container-based product columns,
account and Buy Wholesale styling, home page as `front-page.php`, `[ultralove_brand_grid]`, trimmed Martfury
CSS, deferred jQuery, trimmed stylesheets, header search fix). Backups of the replaced content are in `/root`
on the production server.

- Brands We Carry page (post 16575) content is `[ultralove_brand_grid]` (2026-09-29).
- Contact Us page (post 70) has the Gravity Forms #3 shortcode after its text (2026-09-29).
- Elementor removed; nothing renders with it (2026-09-29). Its `_elementor_data` post meta is still in the
  database, unused.
- UltraLove Backdrops active.
- Autoptimize combines CSS, inline CSS included: `autoptimize_css_aggregate` and
  `autoptimize_css_include_inline` = `on` (2026-09-30). Rollback: set both to `''`, `wp autoptimize clear`.
- Home page call to action: "UltraLove" -> "Ultra Love" (2026-09-28); the text is in `front-page.php`.
